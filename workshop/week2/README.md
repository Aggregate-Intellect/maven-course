## 🚀 Features

- **Retrieves academic papers** from **ArXiv** using semantic search.
- **Falls back to web search** if no relevant ArXiv results are found.
- **Synthesizes responses** from multiple sources while ensuring proper attribution.
- **Maintains conversation memory** for multi-turn interactions.

---

## 📌 System Architecture

The workflow consists of several nodes:

1. **Router Node**

   - Decides whether to retrieve information from **ArXiv** or **Web search**.
   - Prioritizes **ArXiv papers** first.
   - Falls back to **web search** if needed.

2. **ArXiv RAG Node**

   - Loads **PDF files** from ArXiv.
   - **Chunks** them effectively using a specialized strategy.
   - **Stores** information in a vector database for **semantic search**.

3. **Web Search Node**

   - Uses the **Tavily API** to fetch web search results.
   - **Optimizes queries** to retrieve relevant information.
   - **Filters and processes** results while ensuring proper attribution.

4. **Answer Synthesis Node**

   - Merges information from ArXiv and Web sources.
   - Uses **context-aware prompts** based on the source.
   - **Generates well-structured responses** with citations.

5. **Conversation Memory Node**

   - Tracks **previous Q&A** for contextual understanding.
   - Updates conversation state dynamically.
   - Maintains a **sliding window** of relevant history.

6. **Workflow Construction**
   - Uses **LangGraph** to define the **state graph**.
   - Integrates all nodes and configures decision paths.

## 🤖 Agentic Workflow Architecture

The user workflow is translated into an agentic system through the following components:

1. **State Management**

   - **Conversation State**: Tracks user queries, system responses, and context
   - **Search State**: Maintains information about current search results and sources
   - **Decision State**: Stores routing decisions and their rationale

2. **Agent Components**

   - **Router Agent**: Makes intelligent decisions about information sources

     - Analyzes query type and context
     - Determines optimal search strategy
     - Handles fallback mechanisms

   - **Search Agent**: Executes information retrieval

     - Manages ArXiv API interactions
     - Handles Tavily web search
     - Processes and filters results

   - **Synthesis Agent**: Combines and formats information
     - Merges multiple sources
     - Ensures proper attribution
     - Generates coherent responses

3. **Feedback Loop**
   - System learns from user interactions
   - Improves routing decisions over time
   - Adapts to user preferences and query patterns

## 📊 Data Requirements and Sources
